            <h3>New Concepts in Film Cooling for Turbine Blades</h3>
            <p>
              In one of NASA Glenn’s innovations, a shaped recess can be formed
              on a surface associated with fluid flow. Often V-shaped, this
              shaped recess can be configured to create or induce fluid effects,
              temperature effects, or shedding effects. For example, the shaped
              recess can be…

            <h3>Conditionally Active Min-Max Limit Regulators</h3>
            <p>
              Current aircraft engine control logic uses a min-max control
              selection structure to prevent the engine from exceeding any
              safety or operational limits during transients due to throttle
              commands. This structure is inherently conservative and produces
              transient responses that are slower than necessary…

            <p>
              While real-time positioning computed by standard GPS service is
              adequate for some onboard applications, inherent position
              discontinuities are not acceptable for high-precision instrument
              applications, such as view-period prediction and maneuver
              planning, both…

            <h3>Spanwise Adaptive Wing <br /><br /></h3>
            <p>
              Prior efforts to actuate wing articulation were unsuccessful,
              largely because the systems designed were too large, heavy, and
              complex to be practical for use. NASA’s comparatively simple SAW
              concept centers on a wing actuator fabricated from lightweight SMA
              material, whic… <br />

            <h3>Aircraft Engine Icing Event Avoidance and Mitigation</h3>
            <p>
              Glenn’s novel system uses an engine-system simulation tool and a
              compression flow-analysis code to detect icing risk and location
              for aircraft. The existence of an ice-crystal environment in the
              atmosphere will be determined by one or more of three methods: (1)
              an external data…

            <h3>Compact, Lightweight, CMC-Based Acoustic Liner</h3>
            <p>
              NASA researchers are extending an existing oxide/oxide CMC
              sandwich structure concept that provides mono-tonal noise
              reduction. That oxide/oxide CMC has a density of about 2.8 g/cc
              versus the 8.4 g/cc density of a metallic liner made of IN625,
              thus offering the potential for…

            <h3>A Method for Reducing Broadband Noise</h3>
            <p>
              This NASA technology is ideally suited to absorb sounds below 1000
              Hz (at the low end of human auditory range), which commercially
              available materials have struggled to absorb effectively. NASA
              innovators designed the acoustic liner to mimic the geometry and
              the low-frequency…

            <h3>System and Method for Providing a Real-Time Audible</h3>
            <p>
              The invention provides receipt of text messages that are
              communicated by, or received by, aircraft that are within a
              selected distance from the inquiring pilots aircraft. This
              information is filtered by a Pilots Aircraft receiver using a list
              of Target Words and Phrases (TWP) for which th…

            <h3>SVariable Geometry Aircraft Wing Supported By Struts</h3>
            <p>
              This innovation utilizes a strut/truss-braced oblique
              variable-sweep wing mounted on a constant cross-section geometry
              fuselage. The combination of the strut/truss-bracing with the
              oblique wing greatly reduces the structural and weight penalties
              previously associated with…
